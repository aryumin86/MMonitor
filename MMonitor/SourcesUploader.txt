Console app for uploading sources (objects of class TheSource) into MMonitor database.

File should contain 3 columns (separated by tabs) - first is url of the source, second is a Language (textual 
key of Langs enum in MMonitorLib), third is a TheSourceType (enum from the same lib).

If the second colunt is empty the app tries to identify the language. (Not done)

If there source is already in database it won't be added. Source with http protocol and the source with https are the same
for database.
